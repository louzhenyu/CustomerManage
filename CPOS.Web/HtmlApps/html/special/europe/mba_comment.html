                <p>Without the intensive business training with a diversified batch of colleagues at CEIBS, I would never have the
                    vision nor the confidence to devote myself to a rising and dynamic company like Tencent. I can testify that the value
                    and effectiveness of the methodology and problem solving skills learned at the school have been“battlefield” proven in
                    the real business world. Without a doubt, the CEIBS MBA program was the wisest investment I’ve ever made.

                <p>With the Integrated China Strategy Project (ICSP) at CEIBS, my peers and I worked closely to investigate,
                    analyze, and deliver a recommendation on key strategic issues for a multinational corporation. Through
                    these experiences and the MBA curriculum, I was able to successfully transition my job industry and function.
                    Most importantly however, I made lifelong friends at CEIBS and was left with numerous
                    unforgettable memories in China.

                <p>The exchange exper ience in Kellogg gave me a very rare platform
                    to interact with people from different cultures with different perspectives.

                    It offers me a great chance to reflect myself deeply and find the things I
                    truly desire in the career and life.

                <p>One exciting element of the CEIBS experience is its interactive learning process. We are
                    encouraged to question, comment, share and debate in class, and as members of a team we
                    jointly research, analyze, and present cases and projects to faculty and classmates. We are no
                    longer just receivers of knowledge; we actually become an integral part of the learning process
                    that creates the knowledge for ourselves and our classmates.
